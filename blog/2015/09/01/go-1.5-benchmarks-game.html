  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Recently, I saw an article on Reddit that claims <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3ixlys/the_benchmark_game_has_been_updated_to_go_15/">“the Benchmark Game has been updated to Go 1.5. Other than regex and binary trees, we’re equal to or faster than Java across the board”</a>. That was quite surprising, because AFAICT, Go 1.5’s major improvement was reducing garbage collection <em>latency</em>. However, what the Benchmarks Game measures is <em>throughput</em>. In fact, as a consequence of the latency decrease, the GC of Go 1.5 now has to run more frequently, which leads to <em>worse throughput</em>.</p>

<p>So I looked up the raw data on the Benchmarks Game repository. As I expected, Go 1.5 didn’t improve much as compared to Go 1.4. Actually, quite the reverse:</p>

<p>These are the test programs that became faster:</p>

<p>Whereas, these are the ones that got slower:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the binary tree benchmarks got signifcantly slower. This is probably because they are the ones that allocate most; the changes of GC will directly impact them.</p>

<p>It is also interesting that the performance of the pi digits benchmarks is improved to a degree. By looking at the code, they all use the <code>math/big</code> package. So I believe there were some improvements to Go’s bignum library.</p>

<p>The results above were from the 64-bit single-core system. For the 64-bit quad-core system, the results are as follow:</p>

<p>As you can see, the results aren’t much different. But there’s one thing that’s intriguing: the thread-ring benchmark got regressed significantly. What it does is “pass a token between one thread and the next thread at least N times”, so I guess the new GC is not doing optimally in the concurrent execution.</p>

<p>Anyways, what’s the point? Does this mean the GC improvements of Go 1.5 suck?</p>

<p>No, it’s all about trade-offs. High latency is typically more annoying than low throughput, so the Go team made a choice. However, as a result, there can be regressions in some use cases. The Benchmarks Game is likely the latter. Actually, Java’s new GC engine, called “G1”, also made a similar choice: they emphasized on latency and as a result throughput was a bit reduced. I have no idea about the academic theory behind garbage collection, but this seems to be an inherent problem residing in it.</p>
